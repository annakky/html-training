		<p><h3>Early grounds</br></h3></p>
		<p><h4>Tottenham Hotspur was formed in 1882, and the early matches of club were played on public land at Tottenham Marshes.
			As the matches became more popular with the public and the number of spectators increased,
			the club decided to move to an enclosed ground so that it could charge an entrance fee and control the crowd.
			In 1888, the club rented a pitch at Asplins Farm, next to the railway line at Northumberland Park.
			However, the ground became overcrowded, and in 1899 the club moved to a piece of land to the east of Tottenham High Road,
			behind the White Hart pub, owned by the brewery company Charringtons.
			This would become the White Hart Lane ground.</h4></p>

		<p><h4>The club acquired the freehold of the ground, as well as additional land at the northern (Paxton Road) end, in 1905.
			Starting in 1909, a stadium, with stands designed by Archibald Leitch, was built over a period of two and a half decades.
			The stadium would have a capacity of nearly 80,000 by 1934. Over the years,
			the stadium underwent a number of changes and seating replaced the standing areas,
			which reduced the capacity to about 50,000 in 1979. Significant standing areas, however, still existed,
			including the long stretch of raised standing terrace favoured by fans on the East Stand known as The Shelf.</h4></p>

		<p><h4>Beginning in the 1980s, the White Hart Lane ground was redeveloped, and in order to comply with the recommendation of the Taylor Report,
			it was turned into an all-seater stadium. The capacity of the stadium was reduced to around 36,000 by the time it was completed in 1998.
			The capacity was, by then, lower than other major English clubs, with many of these clubs also planning to expand further.
			As revenues from gate receipts in that period formed a substantial part of the club's income (before it became dominated by TV broadcast rights deals),
			Tottenham began to explore ways of increasing the stadium capacity so that it could more effectively compete financially with rival clubs.</h4></p>

		<p><h4>Over the years, a number of schemes were considered, such as rebuilding the East Stand as a three-tier structure and moving to different stadiums and locations,
			including Picketts Lock and the Olympic Stadium at Stratford, London. These plans however failed to come to fruition,
			except for a proposal to redevelop the existing site that became the Northumberland Development Project.</h4></p>

		<p><h3></br></br>Planning</br></h3></p>
		<p><h4>The club first announced in 2007 that it was considering redevelopment of the current site as one of the options under consideration.
			In April 2008, the club revealed that it was considering the acquisition of the Wingate Trading Estate immediately adjacent to the north of White Hart Lane for building the stadium.
			In October 2008, the Northumberland Development Project, that included the construction of a stadium, as well as a club museum, homes, shops and other facilities, was announced.
			The early plan was for Tottenham to move into the new stadium, while it was partially built, at the beginning of the 2012â€“13 season,
			with the stadium completed by the end of the following season. However, the project was delayed,
			with the plan undergoing a number of revisions and the completion date pushed back several times.
			The club also did not fully commit itself to building the stadium in Tottenham until January 2012, after it had lost its bid for the Olympic Stadium to West Ham United.</h4></p>

		<p><h4>The first plan of the project, with a 58,000-capacity stadium, was released in April 2009 for public consultation.
			In October 2009, the planning application for a 56,000-seat stadium, designed by KSS Design Group, and other buildings was then submitted.
			The proposal, which included the demolition of eight locally listed buildings and two nationally listed buildings,
			was criticised by conservation groups including English Heritage, as well as the Government's advisory body on architecture,
			the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment. In response to the objections, a revised plan, that retained some of the listed buildings, was resubmitted in May 2010.
			This plan was accepted by Haringey Council on 30 September 2010, and later by the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, as well as the government.
			However, only part of this plan, the construction of Lilywhite House, was implemented.</h4></p>

		<p><h4>In August 2011, a major riot erupted in a deprived area of Tottenham. Haringey Council, keen to keep the economically-important club within the community,
			issued planning permission for the project on 20 September 2011, and a week later removed the demand for community infrastructure payments usually required for such a project.
			In a joint statement with Haringey Council in January 2012, Tottenham announced that it would stay in North Tottenham and work with the council to rejuvenate the area.
			In this scheme, the Northumberland Development Project would serve as the catalyst for a 20-year regeneration program planned by the Haringey Council.
			In March 2012, Haringey Council approved of plans to hand over council-owned land in the redevelopment area, including part of Wingate Trading Estate,
			as well as Paxton Road and Bill Nicholson Way, to Spurs. It also agreed on a Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) to buy the remaining properties on Paxton Road that had yet to sell.
			After a long delay, the Secretary of State for the Department for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles, confirmed the CPO on 11 July 2014.
			The owner of the remaining business with two plots on the development site, Archway Sheet Metal Works, then attempted but failed to have the CPO decision quashed in the High Court.
			On 31 March 2015, the remaining plots on Paxton Road were acquired, allowing the development to proceed.</h4></p>

		<p><h4>In October 2013, it was revealed that the club was considering a new plan for a multi-use stadium that can host American NFL games.
			On 8 July 2015, it was announced that the club had reached an agreement with NFL to hold a minimum of two NFL games a year in a 10-year partnership.
			The same day a new design team was also announced, alongside a revised project plan, with Populous led by Christopher Lee responsible for the stadium design.
			In December 2015, the revised plans were approved by Haringey Council, including the demolition of locally listed buildings.
			The Mayor of London also gave formal approval to the plans in February 2016.</h4></p>

		<p><h3></br></br>Construction</br></h3></p>
		<p><h4>The construction for the Northumberland Development Project started in September 2012, however,
			construction of the stadium itself did not commence until 2015 due to the CPO dispute.
			The stadium was constructed in two main phases so that White Hart Lane could still be used in the 2016â€“17 season while construction was still in progress.
			The first phase involved the construction of the northern section of the stadium (including the North, West and East Stands),
			while the South Stand construction started in the second phase after White Hart Lane had been demolished.
			A large part of the land north of the existing stadium had been cleared by 2014 while the CPO dispute was ongoing.
			After the dispute was resolved, preliminary work on the basement began in the summer of 2015,
			with concrete and ground works for the foundation by Morrisroe starting in autumn 2015, based on earlier approved and amended plans.</h4></p>

		<p><h4>The new plan for the project was given final approval in February 2016, which allowed the construction of the main structure of the new stadium itself to start soon after.
			In order to facilitate the construction of the northern section of the stadium while matches of the final season were still being played at The Lane,
			the northeast corner of White Hart Lane was demolished in the summer of 2016 after the 2015â€“16 season had finished.
			From the basement to level 6, the construction of this section is in reinforced concrete. Three further levels above are constructed in steel frame.
			There are only six cores in reinforced concrete for vertical circulation of spectators instead of the eight expected of a stadium of this size as they needed to be constructed within the first phase of the stadium construction.
			The South Stand constructed in the second phase has open staircases to the concourses.</h4></p>

			The South Stand constructed in the second phase has open staircases to the concourses.</h4></p>

		<p><h4>Parts of the old White Hart Lane have been incorporated into the new stadium â€“ crushed aggregate of the concrete foundation of White Hart Lane was mixed in with new concrete to create the floor of the concourse of the new stadium,
			and bricks from the East Stand were used for the Shelf Bar. A number of heritage plaques are placed around the stadium marking points of the old stadium, such as its centre.
			The pitch was laid in early October 2018. The exterior of the stadium is finished with 35,000 decorative tiles, 4,801 perforated metal panels and 2,505 glass panels.
			The external cladding of the stadium was completed with the last few metal panels of the 'veil' installed in March 2019.</h4></p>

		<p><h3></br></br>Opening</br></h3></p>
		<p><h4>The club initially announced that it would hold four test events at the stadium in August and early September 2018.
			The first two events would be attended only by club staff and officials,
			the following two would be games open to the public, with increasing levels of attendance necessary for the issuing of safety certificate.
			However, issues with the critical safety systems due to faulty electrical wiring delayed the completion of the stadium,
			and these two games were postponed to March 2019. A fan familiarisation event was held instead at the stadium in December 2018.
			The first match, an under-18s fixture between Tottenham and Southampton held on 24 March, was attended by 28,987 fans and won by Tottenham 3â€“1,
			with the first ever goal at the stadium scored by J'Neil Bennett. The second, a Legends match against Inter Milan on 30 March, was attended by 41,244,
			but resulted in a 4â€“5 loss to the Inter Forever team.</h4></p>

		<p><h4>The opening was originally planned for the second home match against Liverpool in September 2018,
			but delays to the opening of the stadium forced Tottenham to extend their temporary tenancy of Wembley Stadium for the 2018â€“19 season until April 2019.
			They also played their home game in the third round of the EFL Cup at Stadium MK.
			The first NFL game was due to be Oakland Raiders against Seattle Seahawks on 14 October 2018 but this too was relocated to Wembley following the stadium delay.
			The club shop was the first to open on 23 October 2018. The stadium opened with a ceremony on 3 April 2019 before its first competitive senior game, the Premier League match against Crystal Palace.
			The match was won by Tottenham 2â€“0, with Son Heung-min scoring the first ever official goal at the new stadium.</h4></p>
